# d2bin2txt

Fork of [d2bin2txt by andersgong](https://github.com/andersgong/d2bin2txt), mainly focused on improving readablity of generated .txt files, and wider mods support.

Usage info can be found in 使用说明.doc(use translator), and in commentary fields of bin2txt.ini(place it next to *.exe after building)

You might be also interested in [D2DumpStruct](https://github.com/Vollch/D2DumpStruct), that standalone plugin allows to see bin structs without opening disassembler or hex editor, and makes adding support of new bins much easier.
