; Directory for *.txt files with templates(*.txt from original D2LoD)
; Templates are very important to get most accurate result, capable to produce bit-perfect replicas of original bins after rebuilding,
;  you might need to adjust them - adding or removing some columns, to match composition which was used to build bins. 
;  Some diff tool, hex editor, and structs of bin declared in *.c of bin2txt source code can help finding problematic columns.
; You will be informed about columns which contains inconsistent data, but not presented in template, but it's not false-positive proof
; Templates can be auto generated, but it's not recommended for anything except plugins data, which tends to be consistent and lacking any useful information

; Configures what to do with trailing spaces in string fields. Trailing spaces usualy have no ingame effect, but preserving them might be needed to reproduce bit-perfect replicas of original bins

; Name field format:
; | - separates fallback options, when requested string or template is missing.
; %s - tbl string value, works only for objects which have some column with string id. English strings only.
; %S - tbl string IDs, same as above, but not limited to english tbl, while IDs alone sometimes are descriptive enough.
; %n - usualy refers to most relevant string embedded in bin, if anything. IDs, filenames, and such. If not - may contain any random distinctive info.
; %t - name used in template on current row, good enough for generic tables, like colors definition, but prone to be misleading on modified tables.
; %l - internal numerical ID in table, or just of current row number. Least readable last resort option.
; Any other characters will be copied directly. Resulting string will be post-processed to trim them down to safe length(see below), strip from non-letter characters, and number them to make unique IDs when needed.
